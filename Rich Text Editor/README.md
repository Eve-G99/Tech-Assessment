# Rich Text Editor Project

This project contains a 24-hour tech assessment. It showcases an integration of dynamic content into a rich-text editor, demonstrating the ability to learn and implement new technologies swiftly.

## Introduction

This project was developed over approximately 6 hours. The challenge involved understanding and utilizing the Lexical Editor—a new framework for me—at its core to integrate dynamic content seamlessly into a text editing experience. The focus was on learning quickly and applying that knowledge to create a functional and innovative application.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Experience the advanced editing capabilities of the Lexical Editor.
- **Dynamic Content Integration**: Seamlessly integrate dynamic content into the editor, enriching the text editing experience.
- **Custom DecoratorNode**: Utilize a custom DecoratorNode for rendering integrated content inline, complete with visuals.
- **Intuitive Content Addition**: Effortlessly add new content into your text with a smart recognition feature that suggests insertions as you type.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18**: For crafting the application's user interface.
- **Vite**: Employed as the build tool for a faster development workflow.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code readability.
- **Lexical**: A next-generation rich-text editor built for React, central to the project.
